# üöó"Car Sharing Service API" !

### üëìProject description

*With the REST Car Sharing Service API, you can rent cars and pay for them with your credit card through Stripe. All records are kept in the application and you can get data about cars and payments at any time. The car sharing administration has the ability to find out who returned the car on time and who did not. The system has an alert service via Telegram. After registering in Telegram, you can ask a question to the service administrator and receive a notification about your rental.*
